# Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is how most people sort a hand of cards.

From the 2nd element on, smaller elements slide backwards into sorted position.

### Runtime Efficiency
- Insertion sort averages Î˜(n<sup>2</sup>)
- However, in practice, insertion sort's effectiveness is based on how close to sorted the data is
  - If the data is nearly sorted, insertion sort is very effective.
  - If the data is reversed, very ineffective.
